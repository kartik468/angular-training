a)	What is modules, controllers, directives, filters?

directives- These are markers on DOM element which tells angular to attach special behavior.
eg. ng-bind, ng-model, ng-class, ng-controller

controllers- Angular controller is a functions to be attached to the DOM element. It creates special scope for that DOM element.

filters- are like functions which are used to format/filter input data.

modules- It is container for controllers, directives, filters, services etc


b)	What is $scope, $rootScope?
 - $rootScope is created with ng-app. It is like parent of all the scopes
 - $scope is created with the directives like ng-controller, ng-repeat and these scopes are like child scopes of $rootScope

c) Data Binding? And how data binding works ?
 - It is like binding some data with DOM element and it is achieved using directives like ng-bind, ng-model

 - angular creates watchers for the expressions whenever it sees such directives.
 - and re-render when data changes using digest or apply cycle.
