a) $http , $location, $interval, $timeout

$http , $location, $interval, $timeout these are angular js services.

$http- It is used to make ajax request.

$location- It used for parsing browsers address. This service has methods for getting urls various parts like url, protocol, host, port, path.

$interval- it is wrapper for window.setInterval

$timeout- it is wrapper for window.setTimeout

b) What is factory, service and provider? Difference between them?

Angular provides us with three ways to create and register our own service are Factory, Service, Provider.
All are methods of module. All takes two parameters 'name' and function.

factory- In this we return an object containing properties and functions needed.
service- In this we use 'this' becuase it works like a constructor function.
provider- these are the only services you can pass into your .config() function.

eg.
app.service('myService', function() {

  // service is just a constructor function
  // that will be called with 'new'

  this.sayHello = function(name) {
     return "Hi " + name + "!";
  };
});

app.factory('myFactory', function() {

  // factory returns an object
  // you can run some code before

  return {
    sayHello : function(name) {
      return "Hi " + name + "!";
    }
  }
});

c)	Event binding?
In angular we can bind events to the elements by using directives like ng-click, ng-keypress, ng-mousedown etc.
we can specify expression which we want to execute when the event occurs.
eg.

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<button ng-click="myFunction()">Click me!</button>

<p>{{ count }}</p>

</div>
<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.count = 0;
    $scope.myFunction = function() {
        $scope.count++;
    }
});
</script>
